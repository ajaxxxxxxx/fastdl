// Holy moly! I cant believe this works! alright, this is just a completely ripped file from NOWP and im going to keep it that way so if you want and are
// merging this mod into NOWP then you can just delete or ignore this txt file. otherwise there should be no worries of merging my mod with NOWP!
// Everything past this point is from NOWP. I'm happy this works and im glad compatablity with other mods is now a thing!!
